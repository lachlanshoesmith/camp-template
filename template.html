    Having just a home page isn't all that exciting, and this gives
    you more options.

    Copy this template file whenever you want to create a new page.

    We tend to use the same CSS file across all of our different pages
    to make sure our website looks consistent. Having said that, you
    don't have to! If you have unique styles that only apply to one
    page on your website, sometimes placing them in distinct files can
    be helpful and makes your code more structured. ðŸ¤”ðŸ’­
